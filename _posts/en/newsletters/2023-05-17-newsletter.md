## News

## FIXME:title_for_limited_series #1: why do we have a mempool?

_The first segment in a ten-part weekly series about transaction relay,
mempool inclusion, and mining transaction selection---including why
Bitcoin Core has a more restrictive policy than allowed by consensus and
wallets can most effectively use that policy._
