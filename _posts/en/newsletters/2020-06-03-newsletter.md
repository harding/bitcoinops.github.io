## On the occassion of Optech Newsletter #100

> "I am somewhat surprised that nobody has taken to [writing] weekly
> summaries of research and development activity. Summarizing recent
> work is a valuable task that others can engage in just by reading the
> mailing list and aggregating multiple thoughts together."
