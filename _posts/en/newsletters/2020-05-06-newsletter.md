## Bitcoin Transcripts

*[Bitcoin Transcripts](https://twitter.com/btctranscripts) is the home for transcripts of technical Bitcoin presentations and discussions. In this monthly feature we highlight a selection of the transcripts from the previous month.*

* **Simplicity - Next-Gen Smart Contracting** Adam Back presented at a Blockstream webinar on Simplicity: a next generation, low level alternative to Bitcoin Script focused on provable security and greater expressiveness. Back discussed how Simplicity, if enabled in Bitcoin today, would allow developers to implement new functionality like SIGHASH_NOINPUT without necessarily needing a soft fork. He also displayed a [demo](https://asciinema.org/a/rhIsJBixoB3k8yuFQQr2UGAQN) showing what you can do with Simplicity today.

* **Attacking Bitcoin Core** Amiti Uttarwar presented at LA BitDevs. Uttarwar discussed how changes to Bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer layer should be assessed according to five goals: reliability, timeliness, accessibility, privacy and upgradability. She discussed the dangers of network partitions and eclipse attacks and explained why block-relay-only connections and anchor nodes are effective mitigations.

* **LND v0.10** Laolu Osuntokun, Joost Jager and Oliver Gugger presented in virtual reality at Reckless VR. Osuntokun presented a new channel feature called anchor outputs to address the challenge of estimating onchain fees months in advance in addition to Tor and RPC enhancements in the latest release of lnd. Jager discussed the challenges of multipart payments including the splitting algorithm, what happens when the shards of the payment arrive at different times and strategies for when a multipart payment fails. Gugger ended by discussing PSBT channel funding and the channel abstraction work that made this possible.

* **Grokking Bitcoin** Kalle Rosenbaum presented and participated in a Socratic Seminar at London Bitcoin Devs. Rosenbaum used the content in his book to discuss how the SegWit upgrade of 2017 addressed transaction malleability and quadratic hashing. The Socratic Seminar in the previous week focused on the role of Bitcoin technical education, HD wallets and soft fork upgrades.

## Releases and release candidates

FIXME:harding update to latest versions Tuesday afternoon

*New releases and release candidates for popular Bitcoin infrastructure
projects.  Please consider upgrading to new releases or helping to test
release candidates.*

- [Bitcoin Core 0.20.0rc1][bitcoin core 0.20.0] is a release candidate
  for the next major version of Bitcoin Core.

- [LND 0.10.0-beta.rc5][lnd 0.10.0-beta] allows testing the next major
  version of LND.

- [C-Lightning 0.8.2-rc2][c-lightning 0.8.2] is the newest release
  candidate for the next version of C-Lightning.

## Notable code and documentation changes

*Notable changes this week in [Bitcoin Core][bitcoin core repo],
[C-Lightning][c-lightning repo], [Eclair][eclair repo], [LND][lnd repo],
[libsecp256k1][libsecp256k1 repo], [Rust-Lightning][rust-lightning repo],
[Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs)][bips repo], and [Lightning
BOLTs][bolts repo].*

*Note: the commits to Bitcoin Core mentioned below apply to its master
development branch and so those changes will likely not be released
until version 0.21, about six months after the release of the upcoming
version 0.20.*

FIXME:harding

- [Bitcoin Core #16528][] allows the `createwallet` RPC to create a
  wallet that uses [output script descriptors][topic descriptors] to
  derive just the particular scriptPubKeys that the wallet uses to
  receive payments.  This is a major improvement over the way legacy
  wallets scan for payments by deriving every type of script handled by
  the wallet for each public key in the wallet---a technique that dates
  back to the original Bitcoin 0.1 release's support for receiving to
  both P2PK and P2PKH scriptPubKeys.  Descriptor wallets should be more
  efficient (because they don't need to scan for unused script types),
  easier to upgrade to new types of script (e.g. for [taproot][topic
  taproot]), and easier to use with external tools (e.g. multisig
  wallets or [HWI][topic hwi]-compatible hardware wallets via
  [partially-signed bitcoin transactions][topic psbt]).

    By default, descriptor wallets use the popular [BIP32][] HD wallet
    paths specified by BIPs [44][BIP44], [49][BIP49], and [84][BIP84]
    rather than the non-standardized fully-hardened path used in legacy
    Bitcoin Core HD wallets.  A number of wallet RPCs are unavailable
    with descriptor wallets, either because they don't make sense with
    descriptors or because developers are still adapting them to new
    edge cases.  The merge of this PR early in the 0.21 development
    cycle and the decision to make descriptor wallets a non-default
    option will give the new features six months to mature before
    their expected release.
